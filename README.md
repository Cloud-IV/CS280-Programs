# CS280-Programs
A collection of C++ programs I wrote while learning C++ and about programming language concepts in college.

Assignment 0 is just an introduction to C++ and was meant for me to choose and get used to a development environment. It required me to read in a string and based on the first character of the string, perform different manipulations on the string.

Assignment 1 is my first real programming assignment in C++. Over the course of three parts, I was to achieve the end goal of being able to read words from files and print out statistical information about the frequencies of all the phrases that could be made from the words in those files based on a given mode. This required me to implement vectors, various types of maps, and iterators to achieve my goal.
